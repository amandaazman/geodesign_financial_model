# 🏙️ Financial Modelling for GeoDesignHub Scenarios

This repository showcases a group project in collaboration with **GeoDesignHub**, a digital platform for collaborative planning in urban development. Our goal was to build a robust financial model and reporting system to evaluate long-term investment feasibility for land-use proposals/properties/policies in a map, represented as **GeoJSON-based designs**.

📌 **Key Focus**: 30-year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modelling of nine land-use system types (e.g. housing, agriculture, transport, infrastructure) using Python, Power BI, and HTML dashboards.

📊 **Outputs**:
- Financial Metrics: DCF, NPV, IRR
- Power BI Report: Visual comparison of multiple system types and design IDs
- HTML Dashboard: Interactive input of assumptions with instant output for planning support
- Stakeholder Insights:  to validate model logic and usability

## 💡 Project Objectives

- Develop a financial model to compute:
  - Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
  - Annual cash flows
- Compare multiple design scenarios (design-a vs. design-b)
- Build interactive dashboards (PowerBI & HTML)
- Validate model outputs via stakeholder interviews

- **Python** – Financial metric calculations
- **Power BI** – Visual comparison dashboard
- **HTML + JavaScript** – User-defined financial input tool
- **GeoJSON / CSV / JSON** – Data formats
- **Git / GitHub** – Version control
